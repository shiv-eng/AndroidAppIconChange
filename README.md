# Launcher Lab

Launcher Lab is a sample Android application that demonstrates how to dynamically change an appâ€™s launcher icon at runtime. It showcases a few **Jetpack Compose** featuresâ€”such as modal bottom sheets, sliders, and lazy listsâ€”while maintaining a modern and visually appealing UI with a **gradient background**.

## Overview

**Launcher Lab** uses multiple activity aliases, each mapped to a different icon, and toggles between them at runtime. This approach allows your appâ€™s icon to switch without requiring users to reinstall or clear data.

---

## Features

1. **Dynamic Icon Switching**  
   Change the appâ€™s launcher icon from within the app using multiple activity aliases.

2. **Modal Bottom Sheet**  
   A bottom sheet (with Androidâ€™s Material 3 design) confirms changes before applying them.

3. **Lazy Column Grid**  
   Displays available icons in a scrollable list that you can easily extend or customize.

---

## Implementation Details

1. **Activity Aliases**  
   - Defined in the `AndroidManifest.xml`.
   - Each alias has its own `themeName` and custom icon (`ic_launcher`, `my_launch_icon_one`, etc.).

2. **AppLauncherIcons Enum**  
   - An enum class maps each theme/alias to a corresponding icon resource.

3. **Switching Icons**  
   - The app retrieves the current alias from a shared preference (`CURRENT_ICON_KEY`).
   - If the user selects a new icon, the app:
     - Enables the newly selected alias via `PackageManager.setComponentEnabledSetting`.
     - Disables or resets the previously used alias.
     - Updates the saved preference.

4. **Jetpack Compose UI**  
   - **Scaffold** is used for the main layout.
   - **Slider** adjusts icon size.
   - **LazyColumn** lists available icons.
   - **ModalBottomSheet** confirms changing the launcher icon.
